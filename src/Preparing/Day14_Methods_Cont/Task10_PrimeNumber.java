/* A prime number is a number that is evenly divisible only by itself and 1. For example,
the number 5 is prime number because it can be evenly divided only by 1 and 5. The
number 6, however, is not prime number because it can be divided evenly by 1,2,3,and 6. 
-Write a method named isPrime which takes an integer as an argument and returns true if
the argument is a prime number, or false otherwise.
- Note: 0 and 1 are not prime numbers. The 2 is the only even prime number because all
the other even numbers can be divided by 2. */
