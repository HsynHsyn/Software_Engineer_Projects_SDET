Array vs Collection: both supports non primitives

		Array: Size is fixed
			   Supports both primitives & non-primitives
			   Can be mult-dimensional
			   Mutable
		   *** Faster than Collection (faster because you can reach arrays element randomly)

		Collection: Size is dynamic
					Supports non-primitives ONLY
					Can not be multi-dimensional
					Mutable
		        ***	Ready methods
