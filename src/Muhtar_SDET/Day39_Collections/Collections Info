Collections
• Defines several classes and interfaces which can be used to represent
a group of objects as single entity
• Growable in nature, can increase or decrease the size
• Can hold different non-primitive data types
• Standard data structure and there are ready methods to use

Collection
• Collection interface is considered as root interface of collection framework
• Collection interface defines the most common methods which are applicable for any
collection object

Method Name Method Name         Method Name
size()        isEmpty()         add()
addAll()      remove()          removeAll()
removeIf()    contains()        containsAll()
retainAll()   clear()           toArray()

List Interface
• Child interface of Collection
• Duplicates are allowed
• Insertion order preserved (eklenme sirasi korunur)
• Has index numbers

ArrayList
• Implements the List interface
• Internally uses array
• Retrieving the element is faster
not; if you use add() and remove() like this, arraylist performance is getting slower
    when you are retrieving the element arraylist performance is getting faster

LinkedList Class
    • Implements the List interface
    • Internally uses doubly linked list (pointer previous and after element)
    • Each value will have pointer to the next value
    • Inserting and deleting the element is faster (pros)
    . retrieving the element slower than array (cons)
