*** An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. The length of
    an array is established when the array is created. (Array as an Object)
- After creation, its length is fixed.
- Hold multiple values of the same data type.
- Supports both primitives & non-primitives.
- Mutable Elements, You can update the value of any element in the array at any time.
- Every element has an index number. Zero-Based Indexing, Indexing Starts at 0:
- Array elements are stored in contiguous(bitisik) memory locations.
- Minimum size of the array is 0.
- Arrays are objects. Therefore, they are stored in the HEAP.
- Extra // Default Initialization: - int → 0
                                   - double →0.0
                                   - object →null
                                   - boolean → false.

How to declare Arrays?
1. Specify the type(primitive or object), and then specify square brackets[] and finally the array
variable name.
- int [] scores;
- String [] names;
- Student [] students;
2. Specify the type(primitive or object), and then specify the array variable name which is
followed by square brackets []
- int scores [];
- String names [];
- Student students [];

How to instantiate Arrays?
To instantiate one dimensional array, use the new keyword, followed by type and then specify
the size within square brackets []
1. Declare and instantiate in separate statements:
- int [] scores;            - String [] names;
  scores = new int[4];         names = new String [5];

2. Declare and instantiate in a single statement:
- int [] scores = new int [4];
- String [] names = new String [5];
