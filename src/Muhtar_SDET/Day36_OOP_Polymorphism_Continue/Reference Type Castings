Reference Type Castings: THERE MUST BE INHERITANCE
			  1. Upcasting: casting the sub type to super type (done implicitly)
			  			Car car	= new BMW();
			  2. Downcasting: casting the super type to sub type (done explicitly)
			  (why downcasting = because polymorphism rule, reference type decides what is accessible)

Reference Type Castings
• There must be IS A (inheritance) relation between the object type and reference
type we are casting it to, otherwise ClassCastException will be thrown
• There are two types of reference type castings: upcasting and downcasting

Upcasting
• Casting the smaller reference type (sub type) to larger reference type (super type)
• Upcasting is done implicitly and cast operator is not required to be given explicitly
• Allows us to achieve polymorphism without any explicit action
 Dog dog =  new Dog();
        Animal animal = (Animal) new Dog(); // implicit casting , no need to type (Animal)

Down casting
• Casting the larger reference type (super type) to smaller reference type (sub type)
• Down casting is done explicitly and cast operator is required to be given explicitly
• Allows us to access the features of the objects type that are not in reference type
